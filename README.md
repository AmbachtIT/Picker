A mod for Cities: Skylines that allows users to pick any prefab from the world. 

Pretty much finished. Feel free to take code and do whatever. Not sure if it even works with the new Find It update, as I have not developed anything since early March.

You can currently pick any prefab and it will show up in Find It. RICO included. Use N to start the tool.
